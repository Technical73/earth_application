Thus, this project aims to connect Earth Buddies and other Save Soil collaborators (scientists, farmers, celebrities, political leaders, etc) via a central identity: earthworms.",

Earthworms support soil aeration, structure, nutrient cycling, water movement, and plant growth. They are one of the major decomposers of organic matter, getting their nutrition from microorganisms that live on organic matter and in soil material.",

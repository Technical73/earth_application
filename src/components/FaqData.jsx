    question: "What's on Earth Buddy?",
    answer:
      "Volunteers and digital art pieces! The Save Soil movement has invited citizens across the world to join hands as Earth Buddies, volunteers who dedicate time daily to raise awareness about the soil crisis and ensure leaders take steps to make soil-friendly policies. Thus, this project aims to connect Earth Buddies and other Save Soil collaborators (scientists, farmers, celebrities, political leaders, etc) via a central identity: earthworms.",

      "Earthworms are a vital part of soil health, contributing to the complex and fragile ecosystem that allows soil to thrive. Earthworms support soil aeration, structure, nutrient cycling, water movement, and plant growth. They are one of the major decomposers of organic matter, getting their nutrition from microorganisms that live on organic matter and in soil material.",
